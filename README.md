# Mini Search Engine Backend

## Intro

This is the backend project of Mini Search Engine

## How to run

1. If this is the first time you run this project on your machine, please create a MySQL database named `search_engine`, and run a script to create tables.

   ```bash
   python Preprocess.py
   ```
   
   By running this command, we will initialize a dictionary on you local database, which can provide query information when a searching is required!
